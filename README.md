# Final Project Soft Pitch

It's almost time for Final Projects! Before you get started we'd like you to first put together a "soft pitch" or proposal for what you'd like to build.

## What is this project?

**Youâ€™ve come a long way, and it's time to show off your skills!**

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework and tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that will be visually impressive**.

**Most choose to work on this project individually, but you may elect to work in groups.**

## Project Planning Soft Pitch Deliverables
Come up with **three project ideas** and answer the following questions for each of them:

1. What is your goal for this project? Please select one or more goals from the recommended goals list below.
2. Who is the user for your app and how will they use your application? Prepare at least a few stories!
3. Are you incorporating any bonus technologies or APIs? If so, how do you plan on learning/implementing these techs?

## Recommended Goals:

* **Develop a MERN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express React Node).

* **Develop a MEN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express Node w/ EJS templates).

* **Polished portfolio piece:** Showcase substantial work in an area of interest by creating a highly polished product that will illustrate your skills, interests, and will be an anchor for your portfolio.

## Important Dates

* **Friday, September 17th, 2021** - **"Soft Pitch"** due! Clear your idea by presenting your preliminary planning materials and app idea to the instructors!

* **9:30am, Monday, September 27th, 2021** - Project Presentations!
