# Final Project Soft Pitch

Final project time is almost here! Before you can get started we'd like you to first put together a "soft pitch" or proposal for what you'd like to build.

## What is this project?

**Youâ€™ve come a long way, and it's time to show off your skills!**

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework and tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that will be visually impressive**.

**Most choose to work on this project individually, but you may elect to work in groups.**

## Project Planning Soft Pitch Deliverables
Come up with **two to three project ideas** in writing, answering the following three questions for each of them:

1. What is your goal for this project? Please select one or more goals from the recommended goals list below.
2. Who is the user for your app and how will they use your application? Prepare at least a few stories!
3. Are you incorporating any bonus technologies or APIs? If so, how do you plan on learning/implementing these techs?

## Goals

###### What are my options?

There are multiple broad goals you can choose from. You need to pick a **minimum** of one or more goals from this list:

#### Recommended Goals:

* **Develop a MERN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express React Node).

* **Develop a MEN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express Node w/ EJS templates).

* **Polished portfolio piece:** Showcase substantial work in an area of interest by creating a highly polished product that will illustrate your skills, interests, and will be an anchor for your portfolio.

#### Alternative Goals:
* **Learn a new tech:** Create an application in a language or framework you have a strong interest in learning. (Python, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, Django, etc.)
* **Develop an ambitious project:** This MVP for this project could serve as the basis for a larger project post-cohort
  * **Discover or invent an idea**, preferably one with some group of users that would jump at the chance to really use your product.
  * **Design a product *you* want to build**, and choose _appropriate technologies_ to build it.
  * **Pitch your idea** to your classmates and instructors, and incorporate their feedback.

## Further Exploration

###### What if I want to do more?

* **Allow users to upload images from their desktop to your app** using a library like [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/) 
* **Add additional models** to allow your application to handle more complex data needs.
* **Incorporate an external API** to add data and functionality to your application.
* **Use a data visualization library** to help users understand your core data.
* **Implement third-party log in** to allow users to access data from other services.
* **Build something you can really launch**, and recruit an actual user-base.
* **Test** critical components of your code to ensure that it works.
* Possible technologies to base a learning project around:
  * **Disclaimer!** For many of these techs, you will be responsible for, and on your own for learning and integrating them into an application! Some of these technologies may be difficult and/or very involved. Your final project as a result will not be as polished of a portfolio piece as a MERN stack application would be.
  * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Alternative front-end framework to React
  * [Angular](https://angular.io/) Alternative front-end framework to React
  * [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) Create a real e-commerce website by using the Stripe API in test mode!

  * [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) A full-stack web framework using the Ruby language 

ðŸ™Œ This is an exciting opportunity to use your newly developed skills as a software engineer and **code to learn**. ðŸ™Œ
